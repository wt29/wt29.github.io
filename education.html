        <h5>Project printed for local High School student studying Design Tech</h5>
        <p>These were designed by the student. TG3D assisted by printing these at cost</p>
        <p>These caps replace the power window switches. Note, they are snap on but the initial installation requires the switch block to be removed from the door however, if they are subsequently damaged, they should be able to be snapped back on. These caps are a direct replacement and if the car is to be returned stock, the original caps snap back </p>
